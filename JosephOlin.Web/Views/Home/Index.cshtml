                Hi! My name is @Model.Name and I am an @Model.Position at @Model.Employer. I work with a team of interns
                in the Architecture group to develop software that can be used within @Model.Employer.

                Apart from that, I am also a student at @Model.University, majoring in @Model.Major. I am going to be graduating in May 2018
                with my Bachelor of Science degree in @Model.Major.
